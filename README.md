# Gruntled Extension

### by @borntonguyen & @leepriscilla & @rickyg365

Gruntled is a browser extension that allows users to record their reaction to a video, generate a link so they can send to friends that will consolidate their reactions to the respective video.


Here's a link to an [in-progress prototype](https://invis.io/6812JG27S2X3#/465300953_Base)
& [a video tutorial on how to get it running on your machine](https://streamable.com/1552os)

We will know this is true when we see an increase of reaction videos created with our extension
